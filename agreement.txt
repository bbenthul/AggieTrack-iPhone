Introduction

The purpose of this form is to provide you (as a prospective research study participant) information that may affect your decision as to whether or not to participate in this research.
You have been asked to participate in a research study to determine the effect TAMU students have on traffic flow in Bryan/College Station. The purpose of this study is to observe and analyze student movement on and off campus in order to supplement traffic modeling by the Bryan-College Station Metropolitan Planning Organization (BCSMPO). Our hope is that with these data, better transportation planning can be made for future generations of Aggies. You were selected to be a possible participant because you are a TAMU student (graduate or undergraduate) who lives either on or off campus. This study is in partnership with the BCSMPO.

What will I be asked to do?

If you agree to participate in this study, you will be asked to document your travel on, around, and off campus. This study will take two days to complete. On each day you will document your travel in sequential order (from waking up to going to bed). The survey can be done either on a smartphone or with a paper survey form.

What are the risks involved in this study?

The risks associated with this study are minimal, and are not greater than risks ordinarily encountered in daily life.

What are the possible benefits of this study?

You will receive no other direct benefit from participating in this study; however the possible benefit to society is improved traffic flow in and around the university. In addition, traffic planners in college towns around the country will benefit from the increased knowledge and understanding of student travel behavior.

Will I be compensated for participating?

Five gift cards for $100 each will be awarded to randomly selected participants. If you wish to enter the raffle for the gift cards, add your name and phone number to the paper survey or fill in the contact information section of the smartphone survey.
